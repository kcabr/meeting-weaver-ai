# Troubleshooting

-If system wide 503 app then check the src/routes folder to make sure they are are exporting the file routes properly. 

Example (this should be at the top of every file):

```js
export const Route = createFileRoute("/news")({
  component: NewsLayout,
  head: () => ({
    title: "News Explorer",
    meta: [
      ...seo({
        title: "News Explorer | TanStack Start Demo",
        description: "Search and explore news articles from around the world",
      }),
    ],
  }),
});
```
