/**
 * @description
 * This file defines the core TypeScript types and interfaces used throughout the MeetingWeaver AI application,
 * particularly for defining the structure of the Redux state slices.
 *
 * Key interfaces:
 * - ContextState: Defines the shape of the project/company context state.
 * - SlideNotesState: Defines the shape of the slide/meeting notes state.
 * - TranscriptState: Defines the shape of the meeting transcript state, including original and cleaned versions.
 * - ModalState: Defines the shape of the state managing the visibility of various modals.
 *
 * @dependencies
 * - None
 *
 * @notes
 * - These interfaces ensure type safety when interacting with the Redux store.
