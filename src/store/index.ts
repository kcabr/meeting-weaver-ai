/**
 * @description
 * Configures the main Redux Toolkit store for the application.
 * It combines all the different state slices into a single store instance.
 * Also exports the RootState and AppDispatch types for use with typed hooks.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Combines reducers from context, slideNotes, transcript, and modal slices.
 * - Includes the user slice (retained from template cleanup).
 * - Exports RootState and AppDispatch for type safety.
 *
 * @dependencies
 * - @reduxjs/toolkit: For store configuration.
 * - ./slices/*: Imports the individual slice reducers.
 *
 * @notes
 * - Middleware (like thunks for async actions or logging) can be added here if needed in the future.
